Add shortcodes to easily create up to 12 equal columns in your pages and posts

== Description ==
If you need two, three or more columns of text or images and need them to be exactly the same using on CSS3 then this is it.

First insert a [row] shortcode (this needs to wrap around every new row) then add the Columns until you have added up to 12.

Example:
[row]
[p-col-3]
Content Here
[/p-col-3]
[p-col-3]
Content Here
[/p-col-3]
[p-col-3]
Content Here
[/p-col-3]
[p-col-3]
Content Here
[/p-col-3]
[/row]

These rows will collapse for mobile devices.

Feel free to over write the style sheet in your themes style and be confident that any classes will never change names.
